Concise request logging for Rails production

![screenshot](https://github.com/gshaw/concise_logging/raw/master/img/screenshot.png)

Logs a concise single line for each request at `:warn` level.  This allows
logging requests without all the extra logging that `:info` level outputs.

Not suitable for development but ideal for production settings where each
request and associated parameters is logged.

Inspired by a [blog post on RubyJunky.com][1].

Special thanks to [Zohreh Jabbari](https://github.com/zohrehj) for doing the
initial coding and proof of concept.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'concise_logging'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install concise_logging

## Usage

Add this to your `config/production.rb`.  Configure tagging as per your desires.
We use tagging to indicate application with a code and 
environment with a triple letter (e.g., pro = production, dev = development).

```ruby
# Configure logger to log warn and above
config.log_level = :warn
config.log_tags = ["ggomagundan-#{Rails.env[0..2]}"]
config.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(ActiveSupport::Logger.new(File.join(Rails.root, "log", "#{Rails.env}.log")))
```

If you want to try the logger in development than you have to manually add the
middleware and attach the log subscriber by adding these lines in your
`config/development.rb` file.  These lines are not needed for production.

```ruby
Rails.application.middleware.use ConciseLogging::LogMiddleware
ConciseLogging::LogSubscriber.attach_to :action_controller
```
